# GRAVITY
Gravity is a gravity simulator

## Installing

### Mac and Linux
On mac and linux, Installing is pretty easy
Open up the app `Terminal`, and check that python3 exists:
```
python3 --version
```
It should print out something like
`python3.8.5`.
If it says `python3` does not exist, [install it](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.9).
Then do:
```
git clone https://github.com/eebop/gravity
cd gravity
```
And now, it is ready. To run, do
```
bash gravity
```
(To see all the gravity options, do `bash gravity --help`)
### Windows
First, [download the binary as a tar or zip](https://github.com/eebop/gravity/releases/tag/v0.9.0)
Then, unpack it. Finally, double-click on `__main__.py` to launch it.
